1.For concurrency issues, we use two locks to lock the cache and logfile respectively. 
When a thread acquires the lock, other threads need to wait until it is unlocked. 
When the number of web pages opened at the same time is greater than five, delays may occur. 
We learned that using the thread pool will save space and improve operating efficiency.

2.When we encounter an illegal situation, such as when recv()/send() returns -1, 
or when the format of request/response is illegal or cannot be parsed, 
or when the open client socket with web server failed and so on, we will catch 
exception and print the exception to the logfile, or directly print the warning/error 
information to the logfile, then, exit method gracefully.

3.Now each connection will be established when needed. But if there are many requests, 
some requests may take a long time to process and we cannot terminate them.

4.We did not find some websites that can test the priority in the cache, 
such as: must-revalidate takes precedence over max-stale.

5.When we first open youtube, Amazon and other websites, and then open the test website 
on notion, delays may occur. And when the order of opening is reversed, the running speed 
will be very fast, and each method will complete running smoothly.
